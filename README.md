📊 Customer Churn Analysis


📁 Project Description


Customer churn analysis aims to identify which customers are likely to stop using a company's product or service. In this project, we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), build machine learning models, and generate actionable insights to predict customer churn and improve customer retention strategies.

🎯 Objectives

Understand key factors contributing to customer churn

Explore data through visualizations and statistical summaries

Build predictive models to classify churn risk

Provide actionable business insights to reduce churn

Conclusion & Insights

✅ Key Insights

Customers with short tenure and month-to-month contracts have higher churn.

Online security, technical support, and paperless billing impact churn.

Annual or two-year contract customers are less likely to churn.
